<h1>Why does a user group have a different background colour in the Belongs to Group section?</h1>
<p>When you click the <glossary id="User-UserManagerScreen-delete_from_group_icon">Delete icon</glossary> for a <glossary id="User-user_group">user group</glossary> in the <glossary id="User-UserManagerScreen-belongs_to_groups_section">Belongs to Groups section</glossary>, the background colour of the group will change to red. This means that the selected user or group will be removed from the user group when you click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary>. If you do not want to remove the selected user or group from the user group, click the <glossary id="User-UserManagerScreen-delete_from_group_icon">Delete icon</glossary> once again.</p>

<h1>Why does a super user have a different background colour to the other super users on the screen?</h1>
<p>When you click the <glossary id="User-SuperUsersScreen-remove_user_icon">Remove User icon</glossary>, the background colour of the <glossary id="User-super_user">super user</glossary> will change to red. This means that the user will be removed when you click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary> and will no longer have <glossary id="User-super_user">super user</glossary> access in the system. If you do not want to remove the user, click the <glossary id="User-SuperUsersScreen-remove_user_icon">Remove User icon</glossary> once again.</p>

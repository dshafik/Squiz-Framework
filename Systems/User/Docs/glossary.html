<h1 general="true">Super User</h1>
A super user has the highest level of access in the system, meaning that they will have access to all modes, screens and functions within the system.

<h1 general="true">User</h1>
Users are people who can log into the system. Once logged in, and depending on what permission they have been given, users are able to perform actions such as viewing different modes of the system. Each user must be created in a user group.

<h1 general="true">User Group</h1>
User groups allow you to organise your user accounts into logical groupings such as project team members and website editors. These user groups can then be used on the Permissions screen to apply or deny permissions to a group of users. By using user groups instead of individual user accounts, when you create a new user account, they will automatically receive any permissions that have been granted to the user group.

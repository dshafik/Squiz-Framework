<h1>Why aren't there any permissions listed on the Permissions screen?</h1>
<p>No permissions will be listed on the Permissions screen if no <glossary id="Role-role">roles</glossary> have been created. Once a role has been created on the Roles screen, it will be shown on the Permissions screen. For more information on how to add roles, refer to the article <article id="Role-RoleScreen-adding_new_role">Adding a new Role</article>.</p>

<h1>Why does a user or user group have a different background colour to the other users and groups in the Users and Groups section?</h1>
<p>When you click the <glossary id="Permission-PermissionScreen-delete_icon">Delete icon</glossary> for a <glossary id="User-user">user</glossary> or <glossary id="User-user_group">user group</glossary>, the background colour will change to red in the <glossary id="Permission-PermissionScreen-users_and_groups_section">Users and Groups section</glossary>. This means that the user or group will be removed when you click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary> and they will no longer have this permission. If you do not want to delete the user or group, click the icon once again.</p>

<h1>Understanding Permissions</h1>
<p>Permissions define what each <glossary id="User-user">user</glossary> has access to within the system. Each permission has a different level of access, with each level being defined as a <glossary id="Role-role">role</glossary> on the Roles screen in System Config mode. </p>

<p>For each <glossary id="Role-role">role</glossary>, an administrator will decide what privileges the <glossary id="User-user">users</glossary> will have access to. For example, one role may have access to one mode in the <glossary id="GUI-mode_switcher">mode switcher</glossary>, while another role has access to all modes. Thess roles then appear on the Permissions screen, where you can assign which users or user groups have access to the set of privilegs. </p>

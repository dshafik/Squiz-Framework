<h1>Why are there no backup files listed in the Available Backups section?</h1>
<p>Backups of the system will only be taken when the Backup cron job has been enabled. If the cron job is not enabled, no backup files will be listed in the <glossary id="Backup-BackupScreen-available_backups_section">Available Backups section</glossary>. For more information on how to enable a cron job, refer to the article <article id="Cron-CronScreen-enable_cron_job">Enabling a Cron Job</article>.

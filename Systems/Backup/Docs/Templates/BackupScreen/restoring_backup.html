<h1>Restoring a Backup</h1>
<p>To restore a backup:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click <glossary id="Backup-BackupScreen-restore_button">Restore</glossary>. A message will appear informing you that you are about to restore the backup.</li>
    <li>Click Restore Backup to continue or the Cancel to stop the process.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>If you continue with this process, all of your content and settings will be restored to the way they were at this particular point in time. If you are using the latest backup file, you will loose any changes that have been made since that back up was taken. However, if you are using an older file, all existing backups will still be available.</b></p>

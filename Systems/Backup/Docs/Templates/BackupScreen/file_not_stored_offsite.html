<h1>Why is there a cross icon in the Stored Offsite field for a backup?</h1>
<p>A cross icon will be displayed in the <glossary id="Backup-BackupScreen-stored_offsite">Stored Offsite field</glossary> for a backup when the file was not successfully copied onto another server. This may be due to connection issues or that the other server was down.</p>
<p>Please note that this service is only available if you have purchased the backup service from Squiz. If you have not purchased this service, cross icons will appear for all backups. If you are interested in this service, please contact Squiz.</p>

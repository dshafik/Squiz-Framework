<h1>Why does a role have a different background colour to the other roles in the Role Manager section?</h1>
<p>When you click the <glossary id="Role-RoleScreen-delete_icon">Delete icon</glossary> for a <glossary id="Role-role">role</glossary>, the background colour will change to red in the <glossary id="Role-RoleScreen-role_manager_section">Role Manager section</glossary>. This means that the role will be deleted when you click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary>. If you do not want to delete the role, click this icon once again.</p>

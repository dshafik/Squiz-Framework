<h1>Why isn't the connection being added to the Connected Products section?</h1>
<p>If the connection is not being added to the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-connected_products_section">Connected Products section</glossary>, make sure that the URL of the system has been entered into the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-url_field">URL field</glossary> on the Squiz Suite screen in both systems. Also make sure that a connection hasn't already been created between the two systems.</p>

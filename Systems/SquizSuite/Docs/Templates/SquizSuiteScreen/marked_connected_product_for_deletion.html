<h1>Why does a connection have a different background colour to the connection in the Connected Products section?</h1>
<p>When you click the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-delete_icon">Delete icon</glossary> for a connection, the background colour will change to red. This means that the connection will be removed from the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-connected_products_section">Connected Products section</glossary> when you click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary>. If you do not want to delete the connection, click this icon once again.</p>

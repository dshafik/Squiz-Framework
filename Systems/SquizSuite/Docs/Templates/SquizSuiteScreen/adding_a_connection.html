<h1>Adding a Connection</h1>
<p><b>Before you can create a new connection, make sure that the URL of the system has been entered into the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-url_field">URL field</glossary> on the Squiz Suite screen in both systems.</b></p>
<p>To add a connection:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-add_new_button">Add New</glossary>. Additional fields will appear on the screen.</li>
    <li>Enter the URL of the system that you want to connect to in the <glossary id="SquizSuite-SquizSuiteScreen-api_url_field">API URL field</glossary>.</li>
    <li>Click <glossary id="GUI-save_button">Save</glossary>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The connection now needs to be approved in the other system. Once it has been approved, the systems will be connected.</p>

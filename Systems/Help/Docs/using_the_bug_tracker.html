<h1>Using the Bug Tracking System</h1>
<p>The integrated bug tracking system allows you to report any issues that you may have found, check the progress of these issues and view issues that other users have reported. This system can be accessed by clicking the <glossary id="Help-support_desk_icon">Support Desk icon</glossary> in the help system.</p>
<p>When reporting an issue, make sure you are on the screen or in the mode that has the problem as this information will be contained within the report that is submitted to the developers.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you have entered in a valid email address for your user account. If you do not enter a valid email address, we will be unable to contact you regarding any issues that you submit.</p>
